<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>

Students must attend at least **eleven** class sessions to pass the course

<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>

In order to follow the course, students are assigned one chapter of the [textbook](#textbook) roughly every week, which is about 20 - 30 pages.

Assignments will be released on under the [assignments page](/assignments/) each week. Students will submit assignments to an auto grader. Instructions for using the auto grader will be added once the course begins. Homework assignments are due at 11:59 PM on the due date, which is usually a Wednesday; check the class website to be sure. Assignments submitted up to 24 hours late are penalized 25%, and submissions up to 48 hours late are penalized 50%. Assignments received later than 48 hours get zero credit, since we need to post solutions in a timely manner.

<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

We will dedicate 2 weeks during the semester for the final challenge of the course, which is solving a problem of your choice, approved by the instructors to ensure it's sufficiently challenging, using 3 different languages.

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

A grade of satisfactory in this course requires satisfactory completion of all assignments of this course including written and oral assignments, attendance, and other exercises
