In this class, we will be using GitHub to submit assignments. The reason is to give the class exposure to a tool that will greatly help you to collaborate on projects in the future. The first step is to set up a GitHub account. If you haven't done so already, here is how you can get set up to submit assignments.

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Add the public key for your VM. This will allow you to push to your repository without entering your password. See [here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) for instructions.
3. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [Assignments](https://github.com/Duke-PL-Course/Assignments) repository.
4. Clone your repository onto your VM. You will now be able to work on the exercises posted.
