# Duke House Course 59.18 - Programming Languages

## Motivation
Duke's Computer Science Curriculum offers a wide selection of courses in various application areas, such as Bio Informatics, Mobile Applications, Databases, Distributed Systems, etc., and specific fields within Computer Science, such as Algorithms, Information Theory, and Artificial Intelligence.  However, despite the breadth of the Curriculum and areas covered, many courses, introductory courses in particular, use Java, C++, and other similar Object Oriented languages exclusively. While this is a great decision to help students build foundations, Object Oriented languages are not the universal solutions to every kind of problem. At the moment, there are no courses on Functional Programming or other types of languages. This house course is student lead an attempt to fill this gap.

## Course Overview

Each language has its own set of idioms, its strengths, and its weaknesses. By learning several different programming languages, you will be able to see which language is best suited to the kinds of problems that interest you most. In this course, we will learn about each of the following 7 languages:

1. [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
2. [Io](http://www.iolanguage.com/)
3. [Prolog](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrologLanguage)
4. [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
5. [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/)
6. [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)
7. [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)

We will examine each language in the following areas:

* **Typing Model**
Whether the typing of a language is *strong* (Java) or *weak* (C), *static* (Java) or *dynamic* (Ruby), and how the trade-offs impact a developer in making decisions about how to tackle a particular problem

* **Programming Model**
Whether a language is *object-oriented*, *functional*, *procedural*, or some type of hybrid. The selected languages span 4 different programming models:
    * 1 logic-based programming language (Prolog)
    * 2 with full support for object-oriented concepts (Ruby, Scala)
    * 4 that are functional in nature (Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell)
    * 1 prototype language (Io)

* **Implementation**
Whether a language is *compiled* or *interpreted*, have *virtual machines* or not, and how these differences affect the forms of interactions with the language and workflows. In this course, we will be mostly use interactive shells or input source files.

* **Core Control and Data Structure**
What a language offers to control of the flow and logic of programs, such as pattern matching in Erlang and Scala, or unification in Prolog, or standard conditionals and loops, etc. And how data are stored and manipulated within a language. For example, collections are very important in every language, yet the way they are used are vastly different.

* **Unique Features**
What differentiates a language from another? High-level constructs such as Clojure’s macros or Io’s message interpretation, Erlang’s BEAM or the JVM that Scala runs on, Prolog's ability to use logic to solve constraints, as well as concurrency models such as Io’s implementation of futures, Scala’s actors, or Erlang’s “Let it crash” philosophy, how Haskell programmers leave mutable state behind, or how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems.

When you're through, you will not be an expert in any of these languages, but you will know what each uniquely has to offer.
