Next week we are going to go over the Bash assignment and then dive into Lisp. For next week, please make sure you have your development environment installed (most likely the VM) and you were able to fork and clone the Assignments repository. I posted instructions below for setting up GitHub. For next week, please go through a short Linux introduction and the first two chapters of Pro Git if you have not used these tools before. See the [assignments](/assignments) page for links. I'll see everyone next week!

PS: The projector now works.
