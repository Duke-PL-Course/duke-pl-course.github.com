We have released the [solutions to the JavaScript assignment][solutions].

This assignment is quite a bit shorter and easier than the Ruby assignment. 

The only tricky part to the assignment has to do with the seed values for the reduce function in [question #4][q4]. Take a look at the [solution to the problem][problem] for how to properly detect whether the optional seed value is passed in and provide the correct default seed value if it's not.
