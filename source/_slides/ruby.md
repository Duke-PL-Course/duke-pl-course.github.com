build_lists: true

Ruby is ...

* Created by Yukihiro (Matz) Matsumoto
* [Interpreted][]: No compilation necessary, code is executed by an interpreter
* [Object-oriented][]: Everything is an object
* [Strongly typed][]: Types must be compatible or <em>coercible</em>
* [Dynamically typed][]: Type checking is performed at run-time
* [Duck typed][]: more on this later
* Commonly used for scripting and web development (Rails)

title: Code Example

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
>> properties = ['object oriented', 'duck typed', 'productive', 'fun']
=> ["object oriented", "duck typed", "productive", "fun"]
>> properties.each {|property| puts "Ruby is #{property}."}
Ruby is object oriented.
Ruby is duck typed.
Ruby is productive.
Ruby is fun.
=> ["object oriented", "duck typed", "productive", "fun"]
</pre>

---

title: Purely Object Oriented

_Everything_ in Ruby is an object

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
42.class      # => Fixnum
42.0.class    # => Float
"foo".class   # => String
[1,2,3].class # => Array

42.methods    # shows the methods available on the object
</pre>

---

title: Typing

In addition to being object-oriented, Ruby is **strongly** and **dynamically** typed

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
4 + 4       # => 8
4 + "foo"   # results in a TypeError, hence strongly typed
4 + 4.0     # => 8.0      this works because of type coercion

# What about this though?
def add_stuff
  4 + "foo"
end # => nil

add_stuff # => TypeError    This proves that Ruby is dynamically typed
</pre>

---

title: Duck Typing

The duck test:

<blockquote>
  "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."
</blockquote>

<br>

Ruby is duck-typed, meaning that if two objects of different classes have the same method signature, then they can be used together.

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
i = 0
a = ['100', 100.0, '50', 50.0]
while i < a.size
  <b>puts a[i].to_i</b>
  i = i + 1
end
</pre>

---

title: Variables

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
foo = 'hello, plcourse' # here we define a function. Notice there's no type declaration
foo = 'is mutable'      # variables are mutable, i.e. they can vary
CONSTANTS = 'are defined like this' # they are immutable
</pre>

---

title: Ranges

* inclusive `1..3`
* exclusive `1...3`

---

title: Functions

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
puts(foo)               # this prints "hello, plcourse" and returns nil
puts foo                # this is exactly the same as above, with a bit of syntactic sugar
</pre>

We saw a bit of defining a function earlier in add_stuff

Notice that you didn't need to specify parameter types, return types, or even a return statement

**Every function returns something**. If you do not specify an explicit return, the function will return the value of the last expression thatâ€™s processed before exiting.

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
def be_truthful
  42
  true    # The last expression is always the one that gets returned
end
</pre>

---

title: Operators

[Full table of operators](http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Operator_Precedence#Operator_Precedence_Table)

#### Comparison operators (order of precedence):
* `( )`   Note: not really an operator
* `<=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`
* `<=>`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `=~`, `!~`

#### Logical Operators
* Short circuit: `&&`, `and` Whole expression: `&`
* Short circuit: `||`, `or` Whole expression: `|`
* `not`, `!`

---

title: Tricky precedence nuance

* Don't use `or`, `and`, or `not` when dealing with assignment, and don't mix `&&` and `||` with `and` and `or`.
* Why? `and`, `or`, and `not` are lower precedence than assignment.
* So when is it okay to use them?

Why not use them?

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
>> foo = false or true    # This expression evaluates to true
=> true
>> foo                    # But it assigned foo to false
=> false
</pre>

---

title: Control Structures

### Expression modifiers
`if`, `unless`, `while`, `until`

### Falsy Values
everything but `nil` and `false` evaluate to true. `0` is true!

---

title: Arrays

Arrays in Ruby can contain mixed types

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
[1, "two", 3] # is perfectly valid
Array.new     # remember, these are objects, and objects can be instantiated
              #   with .new()

cars = ['ford', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars[0]     # => "ford"
cars[2]     # => "subaru"
cars[-1]    # => "subaru"
cars[-4]    # => nil
cars[9001]  # => nil
cars[1..2]  # => ["toyota", "subaru"]
cars[1..2]  # => ["toyota", "subaru"]
cars[0...2] # => ["ford", "toyota"]
cars.[](0...2)# => ["ford", "toyota"]
</pre>

---

title: More Arrays

`[]` and `[]=` are just methods of the Array class; their typical usage is just syntactic sugar

Multidimensional arrays are just arrays of arrays

`push`, `pop`, as well as other functions exist natively in the [Array API][Array] that allow arrays to be used as queues, linked lists, stacks, or sets.

[Array]: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html

---

title: Hashes/Maps

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">

# Literal Form
numbers = { 1 => 'one', 2 => 'two' }
# => {1=>"one", 2=>"two"}

# Accessing element using key
numbers[1] # => "one"

# Can use symbols as keys
stuff = { :array => [1, 2, 3], :string => 'Hello' }
# => {:array=>[1, 2, 3], :string=>"Hello"}

# Accessing element using key
stuff[:string] # => "Hello"
</pre>

**symbol**s are identifying values/objects. Two symbols of the same name always refer to the same object id

---

title: Named Parameters

Hashes can be used to implement Named Parameters

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
def tell_the_truth(options={})
  if options[:profession] == :lawyer
    'it could be believed that this is almost certainly not false.'
  else
    true
  end
end

tell_the_truth
=> true
tell_the_truth( :profession => :lawyer )
=> "it could be believed that this is almost certainly not false.
</pre>

---

title: Code blocks

`{ ... }` code between braces is a code block; alternatively, `do ... end` (usually for multi-line blocks) syntax can be used

`Fixnum.times` can be used to loop a certain number of times: `3.times { puts 'Hello, World!' }`

Use `each` on a collection (Array or Hash) to iterate over the elements in the collection: `animals.each { |a| puts a }` and `numbers.each { |k,v| puts "#{k} maps to #{v}" }`

---

title: Yielding

Augmenting a class definition and using **yield** to call a block

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class Fixnum
  def my_times
    i = self
    while i > 0
      i -= 1
      yield
    end
  end
end
</pre>

---

title: Call

Alternatively, call a block using `call`. When we do this, the block is actually an instance of [`Proc`][Proc] (short for procedure). The main difference is that a [`Proc`][Proc] can be stored.

Useful for policy enforcement, conditional execution, transactions, etc.

[Proc]: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Proc.html

---

title: Code for Call
content_class: small

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
def call_block(&block)  # NOTE: block is actually an instance of Proc
  block.call 1, 2
end
call_block { |a,b| puts "Hello #{a} and #{b}" } # "Hello 1 and 2"

def yield_params
  yield 1, 2
end
yield_params { |a,b| puts "#{a} and #{b}" } # "1 and 2"

# Example of instantiating a proc
someProc = Proc.new do
  # do stuff here
end
otherProc = lambda do
  # do other stuff here
end
puts someProc.class   # Proc
puts otherProc.class  # Proc
</pre>

---

---

title: Classes

**Conventions**

* Classes start with **capital letters** and typically use `CamelCase` to denote capitalization

* **Instance variables** and **method names** begin with **lowercase letters** in the `underscore_style`. Constants are in `ALL_CAPS`

* Functions and methods that test (return a boolean value) typically use a question mark (`if test?`)

* A **constructor** can be defined by overwriting the `initialize` method

---

title: Methods and Method Encapsulation

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class MyClass
      def method1    # default is 'public'
        #...
      end
  protected          # subsequent methods will be 'protected'
      def method2    # will be 'protected'
        #...
      end
  private            # subsequent methods will be 'private'
      def method3    # will be 'private'
        #...
      end
  public             # subsequent methods will be 'public'
      def method4    # and this will be 'public'
        #...
      end
end
</pre>

---

title: Methods and Method Encapsulation

Or Alternatively

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class MyClass
  def method1
  end

  # ... and so on

  public    :method1, :method4
  protected :method2
  private   :method3
end

a = MyClass.new

puts a.method1 # => method1
puts a.method2 # => protected method `method2' called for ... (NoMethodError)
puts a.method3 # => private method `method3' called  for ... (NoMethodError)
puts a.method4 # => method4
</pre>

---

title: Variables

Several ways to declare instance variables

* direct use/undeclared
* `attr` defines an instance variable and a method to access it
* `attr_reader` defines an instance variable, an accessor
* `attr_writer` defines an instance variable, and a setter
* `attr_accessor` defines an instance variable, an accessor, and a setter

---

title: Instance Variables

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class Person
  attr :age
  attr_reader :age
  # gets translated into:
  def age
    @age
  end

  attr_writer :age
  # gets translated into:
  def age=(value)
    @age = value
  end

  # attr_accessor :age gets will generate both of the methods above
end
</pre>

To access the variables, you must prepend **instance variables** (one value per object) with `@` and class variables (one value per class) with `@@`

---

title: Encapsulation

Ruby variables are **always** private. You can only access them through the verbose getters and setters defined by the directives shown previously.

However, any variable can be accessed using the following code:

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class Base
  def initialize()
    @x = 10
  end
end
d = Base.new
puts d.x # => undefined method `x' for ... (NoMethodError)
puts d.instance_variable_get :@x # => 10
</pre>

---

title: Class Variables

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
module T
  @@foo = 'bar'

  def self.set(x)
    @@foo = x
  end

  def self.get
    @@foo
  end
end

p T.get         #=> 'bar'
T.set('fubar')
p T::get        #=> 'fubar'
</pre>

---

title: Inheritance

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class Base
  def initialize()
    @x = 10
  end
end

class Derived < Base
  def x
    @x = 20
  end
end

d = Derived.new
p d.x # => 20
</pre>

---

title: Mixins and Modules

Object-oriented languages use inheritance to propagate behavior to similar objects

When the behaviors are not similar, you use [**multiple inheritance**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance) (usually complicated and problematic) or you use something else. 

**Java** uses interfaces to solve this problem. **Ruby** uses modules.

A **module** is a collection of functions and constants. When you include a module as part of a class, those behaviors and constants become part of the class.


---

title: Module Example
content_class: small

<aside class="note" markdown="1">
  <section>
  The ability to write to a file has nothing to do with whether a class is actually a `Person`. We add the capability to add the contents to a file by **mixing in** the capability. We can add new mixins and subclasses to `Person`, and each subclass will have the capabilities of all the mixins without having to know about the mixinâ€™s implementation. 

  Single inheritance plus mixins allow for a nice packaging of behavior.
  </section>
</aside>

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
module ToFile
  def filename
    "object_#{self.object_id}.txt"
  end
  def to_f
    File.open(filename, 'w') {|f| f.write(to_s)}
  end
end
class Person
  include ToFile
  attr_accessor :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  def to_s
    name
  end
end
Person.new('Kevin').to_f
</pre>

---

title: Module Example Continued

Note that `to_s` is used in the module but implemented in the class. 

With Java, this contract is **explicit**: the class will implement a formal **interface**

With Ruby, this contract is **implicit**, through **duck typing**

---

title: Comparable

A [**comparable**][comp] class must implement **<=>** (spaceship) operator

[comp]: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Comparable.html

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
'begin' <=> 'end' # => -1
'same' <=> 'same' # => 0
</pre>

---

title: Sorting Example

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class SizeMatters
  include Comparable
  attr :str
  def <=>(anOther)
    str.size <=> anOther.str.size
  end
  def initialize(str)
    @str = str
  end
  def inspect
    @str
  end
end

[
  SizeMatters.new("S"),
  SizeMatters.new("SSSS"),
  SizeMatters.new("SSSSS"),
  SizeMatters.new("SS"),
  SizeMatters.new("SSS")
].sort
</pre>

---

title: Enumerable

[**enumerable**][enum] include the following methods: `sort`, `any?`, `all?`, `collect` (map), `map`, `flat_map`, `select` (filter), `find`, `max`, `min`, `member?`, `inject` (reduce), `reduce`

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
a = [5, 3, 4, 1]
a.sort # => [1, 3, 4, 5]
a.any? {|i| i > 6} # => false
a.any? {|i| i > 4} # => true
a.all? {|i| i > 4} # => false
a.all? {|i| i > 0} # => true
a.collect {|i| i * 2} # => [10, 6, 8, 2]
a.select {|i| i % 2 == 0 } # even => [4]
a.select {|i| i % 2 == 1 } # odd => [5, 3, 1]
a.max # => 5
a.member?(2) # => false
</pre>

[enum]: http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html

---

title: inject Example

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
a = [5, 3, 4, 1]
a.inject(0) {|sum, i| sum + i}
# => 13
a.inject {|sum, i| sum + i}
# => 13
a.inject {|product, i| product * i}
# = 560
a.inject(0) do |sum, i|
 puts "sum: #{sum} i: #{i} sum + i: #{sum + i}"
 sum + i
end
# sum:0 i:5 sum+i:5
# sum:5 i:3 sum+i:8
# sum:8 i:4 sum+i:12
# sum:12 i:1 sum+i:13
</pre>

---

title: Questions

Any questions about what we talked about thus far?

---

title: Metaprogramming

Writing programs that write programs.

---

title: Active Record

* [ActiveRecord][] is an [Object Relational Mapping (ORM)][ORM] that is commonly used in Ruby/[Rails][RoR] applications for writing a data abstraction layer for applications.

* `has_many` and `has_one` are Ruby methods that add all the instance variables and methods needed to establish a `has_many` relationship.

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class Department < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :employees
  has_one :manager
end
</pre>

[RoR]: http://rubyonrails.org/
[ActiveRecord]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern
[ORM]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping

---

title: Open classes

* Ruby classes are never closed to modification. You can always add methods to classes at any time; objects that have been instantiated before the modification can use the new methods. This combined with duck typing is very powerful, but also very dangerous.

* The first invocation of class defines a class; once a class is already defined, subsequent invocations modify that class.

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class NilClass
  def blank?
    true
  end
end

class String
  def blank?
    self.size == 0
  end
end

["", "person", nil].each do |element|
  puts element unless element.blank?
end
</pre>

---

title: method_missing

`method_missing` is a debugging method that is called whenever a called method is not available. This can be used to develop a rich, reflective API. Be careful, however, because this means you can no longer debug wrong method calls

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class Roman
  def self.method_missing name, *args
    roman = name.to_s
    roman.gsub!("IV", "IIII")
    roman.gsub!("IX", "VIIII")
    roman.gsub!("XL", "XXXX")
    roman.gsub!("XC", "LXXXX")
    (roman.count("I") + roman.count("V")*5 + roman.count("X")*10
     + roman.count("L")*50 + roman.count("C")*100)
  end
end
puts Roman.X    # 10
puts Roman.XC   # 90
puts Roman.XII  # 12
puts Roman.IX   # 9
</pre>

---

title: Modules

**Macros** are used to change the behavior of a class depending on the environment, taking advantage of inheritance. They can be used to define [Domain Specific Languages (DSL)][DSL] with custom syntax

* **Macro**s and `define_method`: In addition we take another look at **module**s and a Ruby idiom commonly used to provide the same functionality via modules.

[DSL]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language

---

title: The inheritance/macro approach

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
class Person
  attr_accessor :name
  def self.can_speak  # This is a class method! Notice the self.
    define_method 'speak' do  # an instance method
      puts "I can talk, my name is #{@name}!"
    end
  end

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Guy < Person
  can_speak
end

class ShyGuy < Person
end

john = Guy.new('John')
bob = ShyGuy.new('Bob')
john.methods.include?(:speak)   # true
bob.methods.include?(:speak)    # false
</pre>

title: The module approach

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="ruby">
module Person
  attr_accessor :name
  def self.included(base) # included is invoked whenever a module is included; base is implicit
    base.extend ClassMethods  # extend will add the methods defined in ClassMethods as class methods
  end
  module ClassMethods
    def can_speak
      include InstanceMethods # This includes all the instance methods
    end
  end
  module InstanceMethods
    def speak
      puts "I can talk, my name is #{@name}!"
    end
  end
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Guy
  include Person
  can_speak
end

class ShyGuy
  include Person
end

john = Guy.new('John')
bob = ShyGuy.new('Bob')
john.methods.include?(:speak)   # true
bob.methods.include?(:speak)    # false
</pre>

---

title: Strengths

* Purely object oriented (no primitives)
* Duck typing for increased polymorphism
* Can be used somewhat functionally (blocks)
* Web development (see [Ruby on Rails][RoR])
* Good for scripting and being productive quickly
* Prototyping
* Lots of libraries and gems available
* Fun?

[RoR]: http://rubyonrails.org/

---

title: Weaknesses

* Slow (new Ruby VMs try to solve this, see [Rubinius][])
* Stateful programming due to objects make concurrency hard to get right
* Duck typing can be dangerous with regards to type safety, and makes it difficult for developer tools (debuggers, IDEs, etc.) to work with Ruby correctly.
