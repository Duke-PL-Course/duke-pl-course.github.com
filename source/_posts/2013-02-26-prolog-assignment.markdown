We have finally finished writing the Prolog assignment. It includes **three** problems, with one optional extension and one bonus problem. The assignment will be due **next Wednesday, March 6 at 11:59PM**.

The assignment document is called [2013-02-18-assignment.md][assignment] and the skeleton files can be found under the [assignments][] folder.

Please remember to fork the [Prolog repo][repo] and push your solutions to your forked repo. You can always manually submit to the [autograder][].

The slides from lecture can be found [here][slides].

The [Prolog Assignment][assignment] is now live and complete. 

Again, please feel free to post questions on [issues][].

Hope you will find this assignment to be slightly easier.
