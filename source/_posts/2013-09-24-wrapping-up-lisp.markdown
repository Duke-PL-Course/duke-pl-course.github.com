Hey everyone,
We are wrapping up the unit on Lisp/Racket today. There is a reading for today under the assignments tab, so please read The Roots of Lisp before class. We will be discussing some advanced language features of Lisp and some of the philosophy of functional programming. We will also talk about how to submit the exercises we've done. I'll see everyone in class!

-Jim
